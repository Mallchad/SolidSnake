============
- Custom Build Tool [1]

[1] The project  uses a custom version  of the UnrealHeaderTool, it  has not yet
been distributed in any easily accessible format. It's sole purpose as it stands
is to improve macro support with the  header tool.

This change  isn't complex, macros  are practically redundant,  simply replacing
them with standard C++ as per the macros, or code through the pre-processor step
on the code (-I including non-engine Source  files) is enough to make it build -
assuming the pre-processor can expand whilst ignoring errors.

Quirks with Building
====================
The build errors can  be somewhat tearse.  You may find  often the troubles with
building is related to the module rules (target.cs), or build type (editor, game
client).

Otherwise it may be to do with the build arguments passed to the `UnrealBuildTool`
