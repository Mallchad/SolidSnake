# Notes

* MaterialProxy - this is a MaterialInstance that provides a faster way to iterate by not recompiling shaders when only a material constant/parameter is changed
* MaterialView - This is the same as the MaterialProxy but with default paramaters, its not meant to be edited, if you want to iterate on the original material, try it out on a few meshes with the MaterialProxy, then back-propagate the changes to the parameter defaults.

Though its not to be edited, its ok to do so, if your changes are final (towards the end of the development cycle).
